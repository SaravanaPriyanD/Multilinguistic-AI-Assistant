      "The goblins were overwhelmed by sheer force and beauty. They fled into the darkness, vowing to never return. Ethan had triumphed over evil with the help of Alaric.\n",

And as the years passed, the legend of Ethan and Alaric, the boy who wielded the magic backpack, was passed down through generations, inspiring countless others to embrace the wonders that lie hidden within the extraordinary.\n"
